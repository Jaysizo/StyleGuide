  <h1>Licensure Matters: Change the World Your Way</h1>
  <p>
    Whether you want to start your own firm, turn your architectural vision into a reality, or simply increase your earning potential, getting licensed will put you in control of your future.
  </p>
  <h2>Path to Licensure </h2>
  <p>
    To be an architect, you need to be licensed. Architects are responsible for protecting the public health, safety, and welfare, so earning a license isn’t meant to be easy. The demanding academics, years of internship, and professional exam—it’s a path designed to prepare you for meeting the great responsibilities of the profession. If you’re going to change the world, would you want it any other way?
  </p>
  <h3>Licensure is Opportunity</h3>
  <p>
    In both good and bad economic times, licensure gives you a competitive edge. With a license you’re positioned to take on a greater role with clients and projects, which increases your value to a firm.
  </p>
  <p>
    More architects on staff can enhance a firm’s marketability with prospective clients and may even lower its liability insurance costs—two more reasons to hire <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>, if you’re licensed. Licensure can also be a ticket to higher earnings, especially as you progress in your career.
  </p>
  <h3>Licensure is Empowerment</h3>
  <p>
    With a license, you are legally empowered to practice architecture. You can start your own firm; seal, stamp, or sign your own drawings; and turn your ideas into reality. As an architect, you’ll have a seat at the table and more power over your career. Without a license, you’ll nearly always have to seek out the services of an architect to complete a building project.
  </p>
  <h2>Make Your Future Count</h2>
  <p>
    Being licensed matters—especially for the people who live, work, and play in the buildings that architects create. Architects have a unique and influential role in our communities—with a license, you can play a part in shaping the future of our built world.
