h1. NCARB Design System

h2. Objective

A base visual language upon which projects can be built. Instantiate a sample design library for NCARB based on design elements for three completed projects: NCARB.org home page, Roster, Renewals. We will also use the IDP app to inform the over visual styling.

A Design Library is a collection of UI elements and style guidelines that can be used across different properties to ensure a cohesive design.

h2. Scope

The design system sample should include:
* entry page to orient people on the design library
* visual index to provide an overview of the NCARB aesthetic, including colors and typography
* component index to provide an overview of all design components
* component detail pages for up to 10 components and their variations, including light guidelines for usage
